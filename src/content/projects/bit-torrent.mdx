The **BitTorrent Client** is a high-performance, fully asynchronous torrent client built in **Rust**, designed for efficient downloading and distribution of torrent files. It leverages Rust's safety and concurrency features to achieve fast and reliable peer-to-peer transfers.

### Motivation

Traditional torrent clients can suffer from slow performance and inefficient resource usage when handling multiple torrents simultaneously. This project was built to explore **Rust's async capabilities** and create a client that scales efficiently with system resources while maintaining clean and modular code.

### Architecture

- **Async Runtime:** Uses **Tokio** for handling multiple connections concurrently without blocking.
- **Piece Distribution:** Implements a **multi-producer, single-consumer (MPSC) channel model** to orchestrate downloading pieces from multiple peers in parallel.
- **Peer Management:** Efficiently tracks and communicates with multiple peers, following the BitTorrent protocol specification.
- **Planned Feature:** Magnet link parsing to fetch torrent metadata dynamically (not yet implemented).

### Features

- High-speed downloading using asynchronous I/O.
- Scalable piece management with MPSC channels.
- Modular design for extending features (e.g., DHT support, seeding).
- Error handling and retry mechanisms for resilient downloads.

### Tech Stack

- **Language:** Rust
- **Async Runtime:** Tokio
- **Concurrency Model:** MPSC channels
- **Other Tools:** Serde for metadata parsing, custom structs for peer management

### Future Enhancements

- Magnet link parsing and metadata fetching.
- Full **DHT (Distributed Hash Table)** integration.
- Graphical user interface for visualizing downloads.
- Performance benchmarking and optimization for multi-terabyte torrents.
